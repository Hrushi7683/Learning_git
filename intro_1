firstly download the git on your system (search on google if u dont know)

after downloading check the version of git and if its not latest then download the latest one.

After that you can create config's as per your requierments 



Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you configure variables that control all the aspects of how git will operate.

git config holds its value between upgrades. So, you need to set it only once.

Basically, there are 3 places to store these variables:

   1) System.
   2) Global.
   3) Local.

1. System: These variables are available for every user in the system and stored in

[path]/etc/gitconfig.
Example: C:/Program Files/Git/etc/gitconfig

You can make git read and write from System by passing --system as option. It also requires you to have administration permissions.

2. Global: Global configurations are available for the current user for all the projects and stored in

~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config
Example: C:/Users/Username/.gitconfig

You can make git to read and write from Global by passing --global option.

3. Local: Local configs are available for the current repository only and stored in

[gitrepo]/.git/config
Example: C:/Users/MyProject/.git/config

You can make git read and write from Local by passing --local option.
Example:

Create a local config
$ git config --local user.name "Local User"

# Create a global config
$ git config --global user.name "Global User"

# Create a system config
$ sudo git config --system user.name "System User"

to verify the origin of your configuration :

git config --list --show-origin

Also, its important to remember each level overrides values the previous level.

Priority:

Local > Global > System

SO IN THIS WAY YOU CAN SET THE YOUR NAME AND EMAIL , IT WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY WHO MADE THE COMMIT IN PROJECT . 

                           ...THANK YOU...
